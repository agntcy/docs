# SLIM Data Plane Configuration

This document provides comprehensive documentation for configuring the SLIM data plane. The configuration is written in YAML format and defines how the data plane runtime, services, authentication, and observability components operate.

!!! info "Schema References"
    This documentation corresponds to the JSON schemas in the SLIM repository:
    
    - [Client Configuration Schema](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/blob/slim-v1.0.0/data-plane/core/config/src/grpc/schema/client-config.schema.json)
    - [Server Configuration Schema](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/blob/slim-v1.0.0/data-plane/core/config/src/grpc/schema/server-config.schema.json)

## Configuration Structure Overview

The SLIM configuration file consists of three main sections:

=== "Tracing"
    Observability and logging configuration
    ```yaml
    tracing:
      log_level: info
      opentelemetry:
        enabled: true
    ```

=== "Runtime"
    Runtime behavior configuration
    ```yaml
    runtime:
      n_cores: 0
      drain_timeout: "10s"
    ```

=== "Services"
    Services configuration
    ```yaml
    services:
      slim/0:
        dataplane:
          servers: [...]
          clients: [...]
    ```

## Top-Level Configuration Sections

### Tracing Configuration

The `tracing` section configures logging, observability, and OpenTelemetry integration.

#### Basic Tracing Options

```yaml
tracing:
  # Logging level - controls verbosity of log output
  # Available options: trace, debug, info, warn, error
  # Default: info
  log_level: debug

  # Whether to display thread names in log output
  # Default: true
  display_thread_names: true

  # Whether to display thread IDs in log output
  # Default: false
  display_thread_ids: true

  # Additional log filtering (optional)
  # Can be used to filter logs by module or target
  # Default: "info"
  filter: "slim=debug"
```

#### OpenTelemetry Configuration

```yaml
tracing:
  opentelemetry:
    # Enable OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
    # Default: false
    enabled: true

    # Service name for telemetry identification
    # Default: "slim-data-plane"
    service_name: "slim-data-plane"

    # Service version for telemetry
    # Default: "v0.1.0"
    service_version: "v0.2.0"

    # Environment identifier (e.g., prod, staging, dev)
    # Default: "development"
    environment: "production"

    # Metrics collection interval in seconds
    # Default: 30
    metrics_interval_secs: 60

    # gRPC configuration for OpenTelemetry exporter
    grpc:
      endpoint: "http://otel-collector:4317"
      tls:
        insecure: true
```

### Runtime Configuration

The `runtime` section configures the async runtime behavior and resource allocation.

```yaml
runtime:
  # Number of worker threads for the async runtime
  # 0 = use all available CPU cores
  # Default: 0
  n_cores: 4

  # Thread name prefix for runtime worker threads
  # Default: "slim"
  thread_name: "slim-data-plane"

  # Timeout for graceful shutdown - how long to wait for tasks to complete
  # Format: "<number>s", "<number>ms", "<number>m", "<number>h"
  # Default: "10s"
  drain_timeout: "30s"
```

### Services Configuration

The `services` section defines SLIM service instances and their network configurations. Each service is identified by a unique ID in the format `slim/<instance_number>`.

## Service Configuration

### Basic Service Structure

```yaml
services:
  # Service identifier - format: slim/<instance_number>
  slim/0:
    # Optional node ID override
    # If not specified, uses the service identifier
    node_id: "my-node-01"

    # Data plane API configuration
    dataplane:
      servers: [...] # Server endpoints this instance will listen on
      clients: [...] # Client connections this instance will make

    # Control plane API configuration (optional)
    controller:
      servers: [...] # Control plane server endpoints
      clients: [...] # Control plane client connections
```

## TLS Configuration

TLS configuration is used throughout SLIM for securing connections. The same TLS configuration structure applies to:

- **Servers** (`dataplane.servers[].tls`, `controller.servers[].tls`)
- **Clients** (`dataplane.clients[].tls`, `controller.clients[].tls`)
- **Proxies** (`dataplane.clients[].proxy.tls`)

!!! info "Reusable Configuration"
    All TLS options documented in this section can be used in any context that accepts a `tls` configuration block. The behavior adapts based on the context (server vs client).

### TLS Modes

=== "Insecure Mode (Development)"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      insecure: true # Disable TLS (not recommended for production)
    ```

=== "Secure Mode (Production)"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      insecure: false # Default: false - requires certificates
      source:
        type: file
        cert: "./certs/cert.pem"
        key: "./certs/key.pem"
    ```

!!! warning "TLS Configuration Required"
    When `insecure: false` (the default), you **must** provide certificates via `source`. The service will fail to start without them.

### Certificate Sources (`source`)

The `source` field provides the certificate and private key for the TLS endpoint.

!!! info "Usage Context"
    - **Servers**: Provides the server's identity certificate
    - **Clients**: Provides the client certificate for mutual TLS (mTLS)

=== "File-based Certificates"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      source:
        type: file
        cert: "./certs/cert.pem"
        key: "./certs/key.pem"
    ```

=== "Inline PEM Certificates"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      source:
        type: pem
        cert: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          ...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        key: |
          -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
          ...
          -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    ```

=== "SPIRE Integration"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      source:
        type: spire
        socket_path: "/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock"
        jwt_audiences: ["slim", "dataplane"]
        target_spiffe_id: "spiffe://example.org/service"
        trust_domains: ["example.org"]
    ```

=== "No Certificate"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      source:
        type: none  # No certificate configured
    ```

### CA Certificate Sources

CA sources are used for certificate verification. The field name differs based on context:

- **Servers**: Use `client_ca` to verify client certificates (for mTLS)
- **Clients**: Use `ca_source` to verify server certificates
- **Proxies**: Use `ca_source` to verify proxy server certificates

#### Server Client CA (`client_ca`)

Used by servers to verify client certificates when mTLS is required.

=== "File-based CA"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      client_ca:
        type: file
        path: "./certs/ca-cert.pem"
    ```

=== "Inline PEM CA"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      client_ca:
        type: pem
        data: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          ...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

=== "SPIRE Bundle"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      client_ca:
        type: spire
        socket_path: "/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock"
        trust_domains: ["example.org"]
    ```

=== "No Client Verification"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      client_ca:
        type: none  # No client certificate verification
    ```

#### Client CA Source (`ca_source`)

Used by clients to verify server certificates.

=== "File-based CA"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      ca_source:
        type: file
        path: "./certs/ca-cert.pem"
    ```

=== "Inline PEM CA"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      ca_source:
        type: pem
        data: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          ...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

=== "SPIRE Bundle"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      ca_source:
        type: spire
        socket_path: "/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock"
        trust_domains: ["example.org"]
    ```

=== "No CA"
    ```yaml
    tls:
      ca_source:
        type: none  # No CA configured
    ```

### TLS Options

```yaml
tls:
  # TLS version constraint
  # Options: "tls1.2", "tls1.3"
  # Default: "tls1.3"
  tls_version: "tls1.3"
  
  # Include system CA certificates (CLIENT ONLY)
  # Default: true
  # Only used by clients when verifying servers
  include_system_ca_certs_pool: true
  
  # Skip server name verification (CLIENT ONLY - INSECURE)
  # Default: false
  insecure_skip_verify: false
  
  # Reload client CA file when modified (SERVER ONLY - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  # Default: false
  # reload_client_ca_file: false
```

!!! note "Not Yet Implemented"
    - `reload_client_ca_file` - Automatic reloading of client CA certificates
    - `reload_interval` - Automatic reloading of server certificates

!!! info "Context-Specific Options"
    - `include_system_ca_certs_pool` - Only used by clients, ignored by servers
    - `insecure_skip_verify` - Only used by clients, ignored by servers
    - `client_ca` - Only used by servers, not available for clients
    - `ca_source` - Used by clients and proxies, exists in server schema but unused

### TLS Examples by Context

=== "Server with mTLS"
    ```yaml
    dataplane:
      servers:
        - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
          tls:
            insecure: false
            # Server's certificate
            source:
              type: file
              cert: "./certs/server-cert.pem"
              key: "./certs/server-key.pem"
            # Verify client certificates
            client_ca:
              type: file
              path: "./certs/ca-cert.pem"
            tls_version: "tls1.3"
    ```

=== "Client with mTLS"
    ```yaml
    dataplane:
      clients:
        - endpoint: "remote-slim:46357"
          tls:
            insecure: false
            # Client's certificate for mTLS
            source:
              type: file
              cert: "./certs/client-cert.pem"
              key: "./certs/client-key.pem"
            # Verify server certificate
            ca_source:
              type: file
              path: "./certs/ca-cert.pem"
            include_system_ca_certs_pool: true
            tls_version: "tls1.3"
    ```

=== "HTTPS Proxy"
    ```yaml
    dataplane:
      clients:
        - endpoint: "remote-slim:46357"
          proxy:
            url: "https://proxy.example.com:8443"
            tls:
              insecure: false
              # Verify proxy server
              ca_source:
                type: file
                path: "./certs/proxy-ca.crt"
    ```

## Authentication Configuration

Authentication configuration is used throughout SLIM for securing API access. The same authentication structure applies to:

- **Servers** (`dataplane.servers[].auth`, `controller.servers[].auth`)
- **Clients** (`dataplane.clients[].auth`, `controller.clients[].auth`)

!!! info "Reusable Configuration"
    All authentication options documented in this section can be used in any context that accepts an `auth` configuration block. The behavior adapts based on the context (server vs client).

### Authentication Types

=== "Basic Authentication"
    Username and password authentication.
    
    **Server (Verification):**
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: basic
      username: "admin"
      password: "secret123"
      # Or use environment variables:
      # password: "${env:ADMIN_PASSWORD}"
    ```
    
    **Client (Credentials):**
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: basic
      username: "client-user"
      password: "${env:CLIENT_PASSWORD}"
    ```

=== "JWT - Dynamic Generation"
    Generate JWT tokens on-the-fly with signing.
    
    **Server (Verification):**
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: jwt
      claims:
        audience: ["slim-dataplane"]
        issuer: "slim-auth-service"
        subject: "dataplane-access"
        custom_claims:
          role: "dataplane-user"
          permissions: "read,write"
      duration: "1h"
      key:
        type: decoding  # Verify tokens
        algorithm: "ES256"
        format: pem
        key:
          file: "./keys/jwt-public.pem"
    ```
    
    **Client (Signing):**
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: jwt
      claims:
        audience: ["remote-slim"]
        issuer: "local-slim"
        subject: "client-connection"
        custom_claims:
          client_id: "slim-instance-01"
      duration: "1h"
      key:
        type: encoding  # Sign tokens
        algorithm: "ES256"
        format: pem
        key:
          file: "./keys/jwt-private.pem"
    ```

=== "JWT - Shared Secret (HMAC)"
    Use shared secrets for JWT signing and verification.
    
    **Server (Verification):**
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: jwt
      claims:
        audience: ["slim-dataplane"]
        issuer: "slim-client"
      key:
        type: decoding
        algorithm: "HS256"
        format: pem
        key:
          data: "my-secure-shared-secret"
          # Or: file: "/run/secrets/jwt-shared-secret"
    ```
    
    **Client (Signing):**
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: jwt
      claims:
        audience: ["slim-dataplane"]
        issuer: "slim-client"
      duration: "1h"
      key:
        type: encoding
        algorithm: "HS256"  # Must match server
        format: pem
        key:
          data: "my-secure-shared-secret"  # Must match server
          # Or: file: "/run/secrets/jwt-shared-secret"
    ```

=== "Static JWT Token (Client Only)"
    Use pre-generated JWT tokens from files.
    
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: static_jwt
      file: "/run/secrets/jwt-token"
      duration: "1h"  # Cache validity before re-reading file
    ```
    
    !!! info
        This authentication type is only available for clients, not servers.

=== "JWT - Autoresolve"
    Automatically determine encoding/decoding based on context.
    
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: jwt
      claims:
        audience: ["remote-slim"]
      duration: "1h"
      key:
        type: autoresolve  # Auto-detect encoding vs decoding
    ```

=== "No Authentication"
    ```yaml
    auth:
      type: none
    ```

### JWT Key Configuration

JWT keys support multiple formats and algorithms.

#### Key Types

- **`encoding`** - For signing JWTs (typically client-side)
- **`decoding`** - For verifying JWTs (typically server-side)
- **`autoresolve`** - Automatically determine based on context

#### Key Formats

=== "PEM Format"
    ```yaml
    key:
      type: encoding
      algorithm: "RS256"
      format: pem
      key:
        file: "./keys/private.pem"
        # OR inline:
        # data: |
        #   -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        #   ...
        #   -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    ```

=== "JWK Format"
    ```yaml
    key:
      type: decoding
      algorithm: "RS256"
      format: jwk
      key:
        file: "./keys/public.jwk"
        # OR inline:
        # data: '{"kty":"RSA","n":"...","e":"AQAB"}'
    ```

=== "JWKS Format"
    ```yaml
    key:
      type: decoding
      algorithm: "RS256"
      format: jwks
      key:
        file: "./keys/jwks.json"
        # OR inline:
        # data: '{"keys":[{"kty":"RSA","n":"...","e":"AQAB"}]}'
    ```

!!! tip "Shared Secret Security"
    - Both client and server must use the **same** shared secret
    - Both must use the **same** HMAC algorithm (HS256, HS384, or HS512)
    - Consider using environment variable substitution: `data: "${env:JWT_SECRET}"`
    - For production, store secrets in secure secret management systems

!!! info "SPIRE Authentication"
    SPIRE does not have a separate `auth` type. Instead, SPIRE provides authentication through:
    
    - **TLS mutual authentication**: Use `tls.source: { type: spire }` for certificate-based authentication
    - **JWT SVIDs**: Use SPIRE-issued JWT tokens with `auth: { type: jwt }` or `auth: { type: static_jwt }`
    
    See the [Native SPIRE Integration](#native-spire-integration) section for complete examples.

## Server Configuration

Servers define endpoints that the SLIM instance will listen on for incoming connections.

### Server Endpoint Configuration

```yaml
dataplane:
  servers:
    - # REQUIRED: Listen address
      endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
      
      # TLS configuration (see TLS Configuration section)
      tls:
        insecure: false
        source:
          type: file
          cert: "./certs/server-cert.pem"
          key: "./certs/server-key.pem"
      
      # Authentication (see Authentication Configuration section)
      auth:
        type: none
```

### Server Connection Settings

```yaml
servers:
  - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
    
    # HTTP/2 configuration
    # Default: true
    http2_only: true
    
    # Maximum size (in MiB) of messages
    # Default: 4
    max_frame_size: 4
    
    # Connection limits
    # Default: 100
    max_concurrent_streams: 100
    # Default: null (unlimited)

      max_connection_age: "7200s" # Maximum connection lifetime
      max_connection_age_grace: "300s" # Grace period before force close
      time: "120s" # Keepalive ping interval
      timeout: "20s" # Keepalive ping timeout
    
    # Arbitrary user-provided metadata (optional)
    metadata:
      role: "ingress"
      replicas: 3
      environment: "production"
      tags:
        - "dataplane"
        - "grpc"
```

## Client Configuration

Clients define outbound connections that the SLIM instance will establish to other services.

### Client Endpoint Configuration

```yaml
dataplane:
  clients:
    - # REQUIRED: Target endpoint
      endpoint: "http://remote-slim:46357"
      
      # TLS configuration (see TLS Configuration section)
      tls:
        insecure: false
        ca_source:
          type: file
          path: "./certs/ca-cert.pem"
      
      # Authentication (see Authentication Configuration section)
      auth:
        type: none
```

### Client Connection Settings

```yaml
clients:
  - endpoint: "http://remote-slim:46357"
    
    # Optional TLS SNI server name override
    # Default: null (uses host from endpoint/origin)
    server_name: "service.example.com"
    
    # Optional origin for client requests
    origin: "https://my-client.example.com"
    
    # Connection timeouts (0s means no timeout)
    # Default: 0s for both
    connect_timeout: "10s"
    request_timeout: "30s"
    
    # Buffer configuration
    buffer_size: 8192
    
    # Custom headers
    headers:
      x-client-id: "slim-instance-01"
      x-environment: "production"
    
    # Rate limiting
    # Format: "<requests>/<duration_in_seconds>"
    rate_limit: "100/60" # 100 requests per minute
```

### HTTP Proxy Configuration

Proxy configuration supports both HTTP and HTTPS proxies with optional authentication.

=== "HTTP Proxy"
    ```yaml
    dataplane:
      clients:
        - endpoint: "remote-slim:46357"
          proxy:
            url: "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
            username: "proxy-user"
            password: "${env:PROXY_PASSWORD}"
            headers:
              x-proxy-client: "slim-dataplane"
    ```

=== "HTTPS Proxy"
    ```yaml
    dataplane:
      clients:
        - endpoint: "remote-slim:46357"
          proxy:
            url: "https://secure-proxy.example.com:8443"
            username: "${env:PROXY_USER}"
            password: "${env:PROXY_PASS}"
            # TLS configuration for proxy connection
            # (see TLS Configuration section)
            tls:

## Native SPIRE Integration

SLIM has native support for SPIFFE/SPIRE Workload API for automatic certificate management and zero-trust authentication.

### Server with SPIRE

```yaml
dataplane:
  servers:
    - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
      tls:
        # Get server certificate from SPIRE
        source:
          type: spire
          # Optional socket path (defaults to SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET env var)
          socket_path: "/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock"
          # JWT SVID audiences
          jwt_audiences: ["slim", "dataplane"]
          # Optional target SPIFFE ID for JWT SVIDs
          target_spiffe_id: "spiffe://example.org/dataplane"
          # Optional trust domains override
          trust_domains: ["example.org", "partner.org"]
        
        # Verify client certificates using SPIRE bundle
        client_ca:
          type: spire
          socket_path: "/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock"
          trust_domains: ["example.org"]
      
      auth:
        type: jwt
        claims:
          audience: ["slim-cluster"]
        key:
          type: decoding
          algorithm: "RS256"
          format: jwks
          key:
            # JWT bundles from SPIRE
            file: "/run/spire/jwt-bundle.json"
```

### Client with SPIRE

```yaml
dataplane:
  clients:
    - endpoint: "remote-service:46357"
      tls:
        # Use SPIRE for client certificate
        source:
          type: spire
          socket_path: "/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock"
          jwt_audiences: ["slim"]
          target_spiffe_id: "spiffe://example.org/remote-service"
          trust_domains: ["example.org"]
        
        # Verify server using SPIRE bundle
        ca_source:
          type: spire
          socket_path: "/run/spire/sockets/agent.sock"
          trust_domains: ["example.org"]
      
      # Optional: Add SPIFFE ID to headers
      headers:
        x-spiffe-id: "${env:SPIFFE_ID}"
```

!!! info "SPIRE Configuration Notes"
    - **Automatic rotation**: SPIRE automatically rotates certificates
    - **Socket path**: If not specified, uses `SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` environment variable
    - **Trust domains**: When not specified, SLIM derives from the current SVID
    - **JWT audiences**: Used when requesting JWT SVIDs from SPIRE
    - **Zero-trust**: SPIRE provides cryptographic workload identity without long-lived secrets

## Reference: JWT Algorithms

### Symmetric Algorithms (HMAC - Shared Secret)

These algorithms use a shared secret for both signing and verification:

| Algorithm | Description | Key Size |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `HS256` | HMAC using SHA-256 ⭐ | Any |
| `HS384` | HMAC using SHA-384 | Any |
| `HS512` | HMAC using SHA-512 | Any |

!!! tip "Use Case"
    When both client and server can securely share a secret. The same secret is used for signing (client) and verification (server).

### Asymmetric Algorithms (RSA - Public/Private Key)

| Algorithm | Description | Key Size |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `RS256` | RSA signature with SHA-256 ⭐ | 2048+ bits |
| `RS384` | RSA signature with SHA-384 | 2048+ bits |
| `RS512` | RSA signature with SHA-512 | 2048+ bits |

!!! tip "Use Case"
    When you want to avoid sharing secrets. Client signs with private key, server verifies with public key.

### Asymmetric Algorithms (RSA-PSS)

| Algorithm | Description | Key Size |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `PS256` | RSA-PSS signature with SHA-256 | 2048+ bits |
| `PS384` | RSA-PSS signature with SHA-384 | 2048+ bits |
| `PS512` | RSA-PSS signature with SHA-512 | 2048+ bits |

### Asymmetric Algorithms (ECDSA - Public/Private Key)

| Algorithm | Description | Curve |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `ES256` | ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256 ⭐ | P-256 |
| `ES384` | ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384 | P-384 |

!!! tip "Use Case"
    Smaller keys than RSA with similar security. Client signs with private key, server verifies with public key. Recommended for modern systems.

### EdDSA

| Algorithm | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `EdDSA` | EdDSA signature algorithms |



## Configuration Value Substitution

SLIM supports dynamic configuration value substitution from environment variables and files.

### Environment Variable Substitution

Configuration values can reference environment variables using the `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax:

```yaml
tracing:
  log_level: "${env:LOG_LEVEL}"

runtime:
  n_cores: "${env:WORKER_THREADS}"

services:
  slim/0:
    dataplane:
      servers:
        - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:${env:LISTEN_PORT}"
          auth:
            type: basic
            username: "${env:AUTH_USERNAME}"
            password: "${env:AUTH_PASSWORD}"
```

### File Content Substitution

Configuration values can reference file contents using the `${file:PATH}` syntax:

```yaml
services:
  slim/0:
    dataplane:
      servers:
        - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
          tls:
            source:
              type: file
              cert: "/etc/slim/certs/server.crt"
              key: "/etc/slim/certs/server.key"
          auth:
            type: basic
            # Load password from a secure file
            password: "${file:/run/secrets/admin_password}"
```

### Substitution Examples

=== "Kubernetes Secrets"
    ```yaml
    # Perfect for Kubernetes deployments with mounted secrets
    services:
      slim/0:
        dataplane:
          servers:
            - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
              tls:
                source:
                  type: file
                  cert: "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/tls/tls.crt"
                  key: "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/tls/tls.key"
              auth:
                type: jwt
                key:
                  type: decoding
                  algorithm: "RS256"
                  format: pem
                  key:
                    file: "/var/run/secrets/jwt/public.key"
    ```

=== "Docker Secrets"
    ```yaml
    # For Docker Swarm or Compose with secrets
    services:
      slim/0:
        dataplane:
          servers:
            - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
              auth:
                type: basic
                username: "${env:AUTH_USERNAME}"
                # Docker secret mounted as file
                password: "${file:/run/secrets/db_password}"
    ```

=== "Environment Variables"
    ```yaml
    tracing:
      log_level: "${env:LOG_LEVEL}"
      opentelemetry:
        service_name: "${env:SERVICE_NAME}"
        environment: "${env:ENVIRONMENT}"
    
    services:
      slim/0:
        node_id: "${env:POD_NAME}"
        dataplane:
          servers:
            - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:${env:DATAPLANE_PORT}"
    ```

!!! warning "Substitution Rules"
    1. **Exact Replacement**: The entire value must be a substitution expression
        - ✅ Valid: `password: "${env:PASSWORD}"`
        - ❌ Invalid: `password: "prefix-${env:PASSWORD}-suffix"`
    2. **Error Handling**: If substitution fails, configuration loading will fail
    3. **File Content**: Reads entire file content as string, including newlines
    4. **Security**: File paths are relative to working directory or absolute

## Duration Format

SLIM uses two different duration formats depending on the field.

### DurationString Format (Most Fields)

Most duration fields use a human-readable string format:

```yaml
# Supported units: y, w, d, h, m, s, ms
timeout: "30s"
max_age: "1h30m"
interval: "500ms"
connect_timeout: "1m30s"
```

**Examples:**
- `"10s"` - 10 seconds
- `"5m"` - 5 minutes  
- `"1h30m"` - 1 hour 30 minutes
- `"2d"` - 2 days
- `"100ms"` - 100 milliseconds

!!! note "SPIRE Authentication"
    SPIRE is not a separate authentication type. SPIRE provides authentication through:
    
    1. **TLS Layer**: Mutual TLS authentication using SPIRE-issued X.509 certificates (`tls.source: { type: spire }`)
    2. **JWT Layer**: JWT SVIDs from SPIRE used with `jwt` or `static_jwt` authentication types
    
    SPIRE configuration is done in the `tls` section, not the `auth` section. See [TLS Configuration](#tls-configuration) and [Native SPIRE Integration](#native-spire-integration).

**JWT Key Requirements:**
- `key.type` - Required: `encoding`, `decoding`, or `autoresolve`
- `key.algorithm` - Required when `type` is `encoding` or `decoding`
- `key.format` - Required when `type` is `encoding` or `decoding` (values: `pem`, `jwk`, `jwks`)
- `key.key.file` or `key.key.data` - Required: one must be provided

### TLS Source Types

| Type | Required Fields | Optional Fields | Description |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `file` | `cert`, `key` | - | Load certificates from files |
| `pem` | `cert`, `key` | - | Inline PEM certificate data |
| `spire` | - | `socket_path`, `jwt_audiences`, `target_spiffe_id`, `trust_domains` | SPIRE Workload API integration |
| `none` | - | - | No TLS source configured |

**SPIRE Field Details:**
- `socket_path` - Optional (defaults to `SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` env var)
- `jwt_audiences` - Optional (defaults to `["slim"]`)
- `target_spiffe_id` - Optional (for requesting specific SPIFFE ID)
- `trust_domains` - Optional (for X.509 bundle retrieval override)

### CA Source Types

| Type | Required Fields | Optional Fields | Description |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `file` | `path` | - | Load CA certificates from file |
| `pem` | `data` | - | Inline PEM CA certificate data |
| `spire` | - | `socket_path`, `jwt_audiences`, `target_spiffe_id`, `trust_domains` | SPIRE trust bundle |
| `none` | - | - | No CA source configured |

**SPIRE Field Details:**
- `socket_path` - Optional (defaults to `SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` env var)
- `jwt_audiences` - Optional (defaults to `["slim"]`)
- `target_spiffe_id` - Optional (for requesting specific SPIFFE ID)
- `trust_domains` - Optional (for bundle retrieval override)
