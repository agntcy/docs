# Agent Directory GUI

Welcome to the **AGNTCY Directory GUI**. This application provides a visual
interface for interacting with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, offering
a streamlined experience for managing directory resources through natural
language.

## Architecture: A Unified Bundle

Typically, the Model Context Protocol involves a client (like an IDE or a chat
bot) talking to a separate server process. Configuring this requires managing
paths, ports, and binaries manually.

**The Directory GUI simplifies this:**

- **Embedded Server**: The application embeds the MCP Server (written in Go)
directly within the app bundle.
- **Automatic Lifecycle**: When you launch the GUI, it automatically starts the
MCP server in the background and establishes a secure connection.
- **Self-Contained**: You don't need to install or run a separate server
command; the app handles everything.

## How it Works

Using the GUI is similar to using an AI coding assistant (like GitHub Copilot
Chat), but with a specialized focus:

1.  **Chat Interface**: You type commands in natural language (e.g., "List all
agents," "Register a new service," "Find events related to X").
2.  **Tool Execution**: The LLM interprets your request and decides to call
specific **MCP Tools**.
3.  **Visualization**: instead of just seeing text or JSON, the GUI can render
specialized views for the data returned by the tools, providing a richer
experience than a standard terminal.

It bridges the gap between raw CLI commands and high-level intent, allowing you
to "chat" with your system architecture.

## Settings & Configuration

The **Settings Screen** allows you to configure the "Brain" of the application
(the LLM) and the connections to external services.

### LLM Providers
You can switch between different AI models to power the chat experience:

*   **Google Gemini**: Use Google's generative AI models.
*   **Azure OpenAI**: Connect to your enterprise Azure deployments.
*   **OpenAI Compatible**: Connect to standard OpenAI APIs or compatible proxies.
*   **Ollama (Local)**: Use local models running on your machine (e.g., `gemma3:4b`, `llama3`). This enables a fully local stack where data never leaves your device.

### Configuration Fields
*   **API Keys**: Securely input keys for cloud providers.
*   **Endpoints**: Custom endpoints for Azure or local servers.
*   **Model Selection**: Specify exactly which model version you want to use (e.g., defaulting to `gemma3:4b` for Ollama).

### Directory Connection
*   **Server Address**: Point the internal MCP server to your remote or local Directory Service instance.
*   **Authentication**: detailed configuration for tokens to ensure secure access to your directory data.

## Downloads

You can find the latest build artifacts for each platform below:

*   **Windows**: [Download Windows App](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases/download/gui/v1.0.0/agntcy-directory-windows.zip)
*   **macOS**: [Download macOS App](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases/download/gui/v1.0.0/AGNTCY-Directory.dmg)

or check the [Release Page](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases/tag/gui%2Fv1.0.0).

## Source Code

The source code for the GUI is available in the `gui` folder of the [dir
repository](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/tree/main/gui).

Build and release workflows are defined in
[gui-ci.yaml](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/blob/main/.github/workflows/gui-ci.yaml).

## macOS Troubleshooting

macOS apps without an Apple Developer Program attestation (code signing/notarization)
can be built using Xcode, but they will be blocked by Gatekeeper upon installation,
displaying a malware warning. Users can bypass this by overriding **Privacy & Security**
settings in **System Settings** to "Open Anyway".

Alternatively, you can run the following command in your terminal to clear the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AGNTCY\ Directory.app
```

## Windows Troubleshooting

The "Windows protected your PC" message (Microsoft Defender SmartScreen)
commonly appears when installing software downloaded from GitHub because the
application is unrecognized, unsigned, or lacks a high reputation score.

### How to Run the App ("Run Anyway")
When the blue warning screen appears:

1.  Click the **More info** link in the text of the popup.
2.  Click the **Run anyway** button that appears at the bottom.

### Why This Happens
*   **Unknown Publisher/Unsigned Code**: Many independent developers on GitHub
*   do not purchase expensive digital code-signing certificates. Windows
*   defaults to blocking these.
*   **Low Reputation**: Even if signed, new apps need time for Windows to build
*   a "reputation score" based on user adoption. New or rarely downloaded tools
*   will trigger this warning.
*   **False Positives**: Sometimes, generic malware detection flags legitimate
*   software, particularly in installer packages.
