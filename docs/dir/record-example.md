# ADS Records

Directory uses [Open Agent Schema Framework](https://schema.oasf.outshift.com) (OASF) which defines a standardized schema for representing agents and their capabilities using [OASF Record specification](https://schema.oasf.outshift.com/0.7.0/objects/record). This ensures interoperability and consistency across different implementations of the directory service.

## Content Identifier

The content identifier of the record is a [Content IDentifier](https://github.com/multiformats/cid) (CID) hash digest which makes it:

- Globally unique
- Content-addressable
- Collision-resistant
- Immutable

## Example Email Agent

You can generate your own example records using the [OASF Record Sample generator](https://schema.oasf.outshift.com/sample/0.7.0/objects/record). Below is an example OASF record for an email agent that is capable of sending and receiving emails.

!!! note
    
    This record uses `v0.7.0` of the OASF specification.
