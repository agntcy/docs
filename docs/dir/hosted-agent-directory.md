# Hosted Outshift Agent Directory, powered by AGNTCY

A public hosted instance of the Agent Directory is available at
[https://agent-directory.outshift.com/](https://agent-directory.outshift.com/). In
this section we describe the main features of this instance which is provided __AS
IS__ to the community to help users familiarize themselves with the Agent
Directory.

Outshift Agent Directory (aka "Hub") is designed to provide a robust multi-organization platform for hosting and
managing Agent Directory Records, which we will refer to as simply "records" or
"agent records." Outshift Agent Directory acts as a centralized
point for organizing and accessing agent records. This hosted service is enhanced by a
gRPC API that supports efficient service communication and integration, ensuring
seamless interaction between components.


Outshift Agent Directory serves as a central platform for hosting and managing various
agent-related services. The main purpose of the Agent Directory Service
component is to provide a comprehensive solution
for developers and IT admins to register, discover, and manage records in an
organized manner. By offering a secure environment for authentication and user
management, it ensures that organizations can confidently manage their agent
directories and related services.

## Core Concepts

The Outshift Agent Directory is organized around a few basic concepts:

* Users - A user is the basic unit of authentication and authorization in the
Hub, usually corresponding to a human or service account.
* Organization - An organization provides a way to group users for sharing agents
and handling administrative tasks. A user can belong to many organizations, but
organizations are flat and cannot belong to one another.
* Agent Records - An Agent Record is a collection of data and metadata about a
particular agentic application or service. The schema of the Record is defined
in [OASF](../oasf/open-agentic-schema-framework.md) and contains, for example, a
[collection of skills](../oasf/taxonomy.md).
* Repositories - A agent repository collects agent records that describe
different versions of the same agent into one location to provide an overview of
its history and current status. A Record can belong to only one repo, while a
user or organization may access many different repos and by extension their
agent records.

The [Agent Directory Service (ADS)](../dir/overview.md) provides storage for agent records
while the frontend hosted Outshift Agent Directory provides access control with
Users and their Organizations and management of agent records in their Repos.

## Features

Outshift Agent Directory, powered by AGNTCY, enables users to:

* View and search for public agent records.
* View your organization's public and private agent records.

* The version number and date of publishing.
* The CLI command to push a new version of the agent.

The **Versions** tab lists the published versions of the agent.

The **Settings** tab allows the owner to change the
visibility of the agent.

## Add an Agent Directory Record to the Outshift Agent Directory

Agent directory records are associated with a repository. A repository must
exist first for an agent record to be added to it.

### Create a new agent repository

To add an agent repository in the Outshift Agent Directory:

1. Click the **+ New Repository** button.
1. Enter the repository name.
1. Select the visibility for your agent repository.
    * Public agent repositories appear in search results.
    * Private agent repositories are only visible in your organization.
1. Click **Publish**.
1. Click **Finish**.

At this point, you have an empty repository ready for agent records.

### Adding an Agent Directory Record to a Repository

Adding an Agent Directory Record has these prerequisites:

1. You need to install the Outshift Agent Directory command line tool, `dirctl`.
1. You need an agent record that conforms to Outshift Agent Directory requirements.
1. You need to sign your agent record.

#### Pre-req 1: Install `dirctl`

Binary packages and installation of the Outshift Agent Directory `dirctl`
command line tool are available in multiple forms on GitHub:

* [container image](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/pkgs/container/dir-ctl)
* [homebrew](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/tree/main/HomebrewFormula)
* [binary](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases)

After installation, use the `dirctl` and `dirctl hub` commands to list the
available commands.

#### Pre-req 2: Create a Conforming Agent Directory Record

An Agent Directory record is stored in JSON format. The record is specific
to one entry in the Agent Directory. The structure of each AD record is
defined by the
[Open Agentic Schema Framework](https://schema.oasf.agntcy.org/objects/agent)
starting at the root with an [Agent object](https://schema.oasf.agntcy.org/objects/agent).

To be useful, an agent record should include at least the following:
* Name of the agent (the name MUST match the organization and repository name in the Outshift Agent Directory), 
* Version of the agent (use semantic convention)
* Description (something to help any viewer understand what your agent does, what is the use case it is applicable to, expected inputs and outputs, LLM used, runtime, etc)
* Locator, per [OASF locator objects](https://schema.oasf.agntcy.org/objects/locator?extensions=)
  * type(s) (source code, agent as a service, docker image, etc) matching the supported types in the OASF locator objects
  *  url (corresponding address to find the agent)
* Skills - MUST follow the [OASF skills schema](https://schema.oasf.agntcy.org/skills?extensions=)

And it will look like this

```json
{
  "name": "organization/my-agent",
  "version": "2.0",
  "description": "This agent takes any text input and condenses it down to 3 bullets of less than 100 characters each using any LLM.",
  "locators": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/example/agent_A",
      "type": "package-source-code"
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "class_uid": 10201
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Pre-req 3: Signing Agent Directory Records using `dirctl`

You must sign the record before pushing it to the Outshift Agent Directory. Unsigned records are
rejected by the API.

To sign an agent record in the file `agent.json` using the default provider [sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/), run:

```shell
dirctl sign agent.json > agent.signed.json
```

The signing service login page opens in your browser. Use your credentials to log in. The
agent record will be augmented with a generated signature and will be output
in JSON format. The new signed agent record can be pushed to the Hub.

For further details on signing, please see
[the Agent Directory HOWTO](../dir/scenarios.md#signing-and-verification).

#### Pushing Agent Directory Records using `dirctl`

Once all pre-requisites are complete, you are ready to push an agent record to an agent repository
that you have write access to. If the repository does not exist, it will be
created automatically with visibility set as private.

Pushing and pulling agent directory records is done using the `dirctl` tool.

From your terminal window:

1. Login to your Outshift Agent Directory account

      ```dirctl hub login```

1. The login page opens in your browser. Use your credentials to log in.

1. Verify your Outshift Agent Directory organizations and which one you are currently logged into:

      ```dirctl hub orgs```

1. Switch organizations as needed to the organization that you want to push your agent record to:

      ```dirctl hub orgs switch```

1. Push your signed, conforming agent record to the desired organization/repository:

      ```dirctl hub push <organization/repository_name> <local filename of your signed agent json file>```

1. When you're done, logout of your hub account

      ```dirctl hub logout```

#### Pulling Agent Directory Records using `dirctl`

You can also pull an agent directory record via `dirctl` using the command listed on the agent details page.

#### Verifying an Agent Directory Record Signature

The verification process allows validation of the agent record signature
against a specific identity.

To verify that an agent record is properly signed, you can run `dirctl
verify agent.json`.

To verify the signature against a specific identity, for example to check if an
agent record originates from GitHub Agntcy users, run:

```bash
dirctl verify agent.json \
                 --oidc-issuer "(.*)github.com(.*)" \
                 --oidc-identity "(.*)@agntcy.com"
```

For further details on verification, please see
[the Agent Directory HOWTO](../dir/scenarios.md#signing-and-verification).

## Managing Organizations and Users

### Settings

The settings page allows you to manage your organizations and their users.

#### List Organizations

Organizations represent groups of users within the Hub, each with its own
repositories. Users can be member of many organizations. The organizations
available to you are listed under the **Organizations** tab.

#### Switch Organization

The organization the user is currently signed in is displayed in bold in the organization list and indicated in the dropdown at the top of the left side menu.

To switch organization:

1. Click on the dropdown at the top of the left side menu
1. Select the organization to switch to
1. Follow the login procedure

#### Create a new organization

To create a new organization:

1. Click the **+ Create Organization** button.
1. Enter the organization name.
1. Click the **Create organization** button.
1. Click the **Finish** button.

#### Manage Users

The list of users of the current organization are accessible by clicking on the organization (in bold) in the list.

You can invite other users to the organization by clicking the **+ Invite User**
button.

!!! note
    You cannot invite other users to your personal organization created
    during signing up. To collaborate with others, create a new organization and invite them to it.

## Troubleshooting pushing agents to the Outshift Agent Directory

`Error: failed to validate access token: invalid session token`
You forgot to login to your Outshift Agent Directory account

`Error: failed to push agent: could not receive response: rpc error: code = InvalidArgument desc = agent: invalid value in agent name`
The “agent name” attribute in the json file does not match the organization/repository in the Hub.

`Error: failed to push agent: could not receive response: rpc error: code = AlreadyExists desc = agent: data model with same version already exists`
You are trying to upload a new agent record with the same name and version as one that exists already. Update the version number in the json file.

Details on other uses of the `dirctl` command to interact with the
Agent Directory are
[available in the documentation](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/pkgs/container/dir-ctl).
After installation, use the `dirctl hub` command to list the available commands.
