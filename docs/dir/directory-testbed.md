# Directory Testbed

The Directory Testbed is a local environment for development and testing. It can be used to test your application with the Directory network. This environment provides a fully functional Directory instance for development, testing, and exploration purposes.

There are two ways to use the testbed:

- [Deploying the local testbed environment](./directory-testbed-deployment.md)
- [Using the public staging environment](./directory-public-staging.md)
