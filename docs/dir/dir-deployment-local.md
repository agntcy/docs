# Local Deployment

Run the Agent Directory on your own machine for development, testing, or as a standalone local instance. This page defines the supported deployment modes, platform support matrix, and prerequisites for local-first Directory usage.

## Deployment Modes

Directory offers three local deployment modes with different trade-offs.

| Mode | Components | Requires Docker | Best for |
|------|-----------|:-:|----------|
| **dirctl daemon** | Single process (apiserver + reconciler + SQLite + local OCI store) | No | Quick setup, single-user development, lightweight testing |
| **Docker Compose** | Separate containers (apiserver, reconciler, Zot registry, PostgreSQL) | Yes | Multi-service development, closer to production topology |

## Platform Support Matrix

### dirctl daemon (recommended local mode)

| OS | Architecture | Status | Notes |
|----|:-------------|:------:|-------|
| macOS | arm64 (Apple Silicon) | Supported | Primary development platform |
| macOS | amd64 (Intel) | Supported | |
| Linux | amd64 | Supported | |
| Linux | arm64 | Supported | |
| Windows | amd64 | Experimental | Binary is available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases). Docker Compose or WSL2 are recommended alternatives if you encounter issues. |

### Docker Compose

| OS | Architecture | Status | Notes |
|----|:-------------|:------:|-------|
| macOS | arm64 / amd64 | Supported | Requires Docker Desktop or Colima |
| Linux | amd64 / arm64 | Supported | Requires Docker Engine with Compose plugin |
| Windows | amd64 | Supported | Requires Docker Desktop |

### dirctl CLI (client only)

The `dirctl` CLI binary is available for all platforms regardless of which deployment mode is used for the server.

| OS | Architecture | Status |
|----|:-------------|:------:|
| macOS | arm64 / amd64 | Supported |
| Linux | amd64 / arm64 | Supported |
| Windows | amd64 | Supported |

## Prerequisites

### dirctl daemon

- **dirctl binary** — install via Homebrew or download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases):

=== "Homebrew (macOS / Linux)"

    ```bash
    brew tap agntcy/dir https://github.com/agntcy/dir
    brew install dirctl
    ```

=== "Release binary"

    ```bash
    # Example for Linux amd64 — adjust OS and architecture as needed
    curl -L https://github.com/agntcy/dir/releases/latest/download/dirctl-linux-amd64 -o dirctl
    chmod +x dirctl
    sudo mv dirctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### Docker Compose

- **Docker** with the Compose plugin (v2)
- **Docker Desktop** (macOS / Windows) or **Docker Engine** (Linux)

### Taskfile (contributors)

- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with Buildx
- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.26+

## Configuration

Without `--config`, the daemon listens on `localhost:8888` and stores all data (SQLite database, OCI store, routing) under `~/.agntcy/dir/`.

To override defaults, pass a YAML configuration file or use environment variables prefixed with `DIRECTORY_DAEMON_`:

```bash
dirctl daemon start --config /path/to/daemon.config.yaml
dirctl daemon start --data-dir /var/lib/dir
DIRECTORY_DAEMON_SERVER_LISTEN_ADDRESS="localhost:9999" dirctl daemon start
```

When `--config` is provided, the file replaces built-in defaults entirely. See the [reference configuration](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/blob/main/cli/cmd/daemon/daemon.config.yaml) for all available options.

## Docker Compose deployment

The Docker Compose stack runs separate containers for the apiserver, reconciler, Zot OCI registry, and PostgreSQL:

```bash
cd install/docker
docker compose up -d
```

This is closer to the production topology and is useful for testing multi-service interactions. See the [Kubernetes Deployment](dir-deployment-kubernetes.md) guide for deploying with Helm in a Kind cluster.
