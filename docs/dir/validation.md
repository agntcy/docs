# Validation

The Directory enforces validation on all records before accepting them.
Validation is performed using the [OASF SDK](../oasf/oasf-sdk.md), which requires an OASF schema server URL for validation.

## Configuration

The Directory server validates records using an OASF schema URL. By default, it uses `https://schema.oasf.outshift.com`, but you can configure a different OASF instance:

**Using environment variables:**

```bash
# Use default OASF instance (https://schema.oasf.outshift.com)
task server:start

# Use custom OASF instance
DIRECTORY_SERVER_OASF_API_VALIDATION_SCHEMA_URL=https://your-custom-oasf.com task server:start
```

**Using YAML configuration:**

```yaml
# server.config.yml
oasf_api_validation:
  schema_url: "https://schema.oasf.outshift.com"
listen_address: "0.0.0.0:8888"
```

!!! note
    
    Some deployment methods (like Docker Compose) may require explicitly setting the schema URL even though there is a default value.

## Validation Behavior

The Directory server uses API-based validation against the configured OASF schema server:

- **Validation Method**: HTTP requests to the OASF schema server API.
- **Errors vs Warnings**: Only errors cause validation to fail. Warnings are returned but do not affect the validation result.
- **Schema Version Detection**: The schema version is automatically detected from each record's `schema_version` field.
- **Supported Versions**: The OASF SDK decoder supports specific schema versions (currently: 0.3.1, 0.7.0, and 0.8.0). Records using unsupported versions are not validated.
- **Unknown Classes**: Classes (such as modules, skills, and domains) not defined in the OASF schema are rejected with an error. Records must only use classes that are defined in the configured OASF schema instance.

## OASF Instance Configurations

While there is only one validation method (API validation), you can configure the Directory server to use different OASF instances.
The choice of OASF instance affects which records are accepted and how compatible your directory instance is with other directory instances.

The following table shows which OASF instance configurations can exchange records with each other:

| Instance Type | Can Pull From | Can Be Pulled By |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Official OASF Instance** | Official OASF instance only | Official OASF instance and custom instances with additional taxonomy |
| **Custom OASF Instance (Additional Taxonomy)** | Official OASF instance, custom instances with same extended taxonomy | Custom instances with same extended taxonomy only |
| **Custom OASF Instance (Changed Taxonomy)** | Custom instances with same changed taxonomy only | Custom instances with same changed taxonomy only |

### Official OASF Instance

Using the official OASF instance (`https://schema.oasf.outshift.com`) provides the baseline for the official network.
Records validated here form the most strict, compatible set.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
oasf_api_validation:
  schema_url: "https://schema.oasf.outshift.com"
```

### Custom OASF Instance (Additional Taxonomy)

Using a custom OASF instance with extensions that add to the taxonomy (with modules, skills, and domains that extend the official taxonomy but doesn't change or remove).

Records using the extended taxonomy can only be pulled by nodes using the exact same extended taxonomy.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
oasf_api_validation:
  schema_url: "https://your-custom-oasf-instance.com"
```

### Custom OASF Instance (Changed Taxonomy)

Using a custom OASF instance with extensions that modify the taxonomy (with modules, skills, and domains that change or remove from the official taxonomy).

This approach is completely incompatible with all other options, can only work with nodes using the exact same changed taxonomy.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
oasf_api_validation:
  schema_url: "https://your-custom-oasf-instance.com"
```

## Deploying a Local OASF Instance

You can deploy a local OASF instance alongside the Directory server for testing or development purposes.

### Testing with Local OASF Server

To test with a local OASF instance deployed alongside the directory server:

1. Enable OASF in Helm values

    Edit `install/charts/dir/values.yaml` with the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    apiserver:
      oasf:
        enabled: true
    ```

2. Set schema URL to use the deployed OASF instance

    In the same file, set the schema URL to use the deployed OASF instance:

    ```yaml
    apiserver:
      config:
        oasf_api_validation:
          schema_url: "http://dir-ingress-controller.dir-server.svc.cluster.local"
    ```

    Replace `dir` with your Helm release name and `dir-server` with your namespace if different.

3. Deploy the local OASF instance

    ```bash
    task build
    task deploy:local
    ```

The OASF instance is deployed as a subchart in the same namespace and automatically configured for multi-version routing via ingress.

### Using a Locally Built OASF Image

If you want to deploy with a locally built OASF image (e.g., containing `0.9.0-dev` schema files), you need to load the image into Kind before deploying.
The `task deploy:local` command automatically creates a cluster and loads images, but it doesn't load custom OASF images.

Follow the steps below:

1. Create the Kind cluster

    ```bash
    task deploy:kubernetes:setup-cluster
    ```

    This creates the cluster and loads the Directory server images.

2. Build your local OASF image with the `latest` tag

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/oasf/server
    task build
    ```

3. Load the OASF image into Kind

    ```bash
    kind load docker-image ghcr.io/agntcy/oasf-server:latest --name agntcy-cluster
    ```

4. Configure `values.yaml` to use the local image:

    ```yaml
    oasf:
      enabled: true
      image:
        repository: ghcr.io/agntcy/oasf-server
        versions:
          - server: latest
            schema: 0.9.0-dev
            default: true
    ```

5. Deploy the Directory

    Don't use `task deploy:local` as it will recreate the cluster.

    ```bash
    task deploy:kubernetes:dir
    ```

!!! note

    If you update the local OASF image, reload it into Kind and restart the deployment:

    ```bash
    kind load docker-image ghcr.io/agntcy/oasf-server:latest --name agntcy-cluster
    kubectl rollout restart deployment/dir-oasf-0-9-0-dev -n dir-server
    ```
