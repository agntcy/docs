# Directory Sandbox

The **Directory Sandbox** is a local environment for development and testing. It can be used to test your application with the Directory network. This environment provides a fully functional Directory instance for development, testing, and exploration purposes.

There are two ways to use the sandbox:

- [Using the public staging environment](./directory-public-staging.md).
- [Deploying the local sandbox environment](./directory-sandbox-deployment.md).
