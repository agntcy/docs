<a name="routing-v1-RoutingService"></a>

### RoutingService
Defines an interface for announcement and discovery
of records across interconnected network.

Middleware should be used to control who can perform these RPCs.
Policies for the middleware can be handled via separate service.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| Publish | [PublishRequest](#routing-v1-PublishRequest) | [.google.protobuf.Empty](#google-protobuf-Empty) | Announce to the network that this peer is providing a given record. This enables other peers to discover this record and retrieve it from this peer. Listeners can use this event to perform custom operations, for example by cloning the record.

Items need to be periodically republished (eg. 24h) to the network to avoid stale data. Republication should be done in the background. |
| Unpublish | [UnpublishRequest](#routing-v1-UnpublishRequest) | [.google.protobuf.Empty](#google-protobuf-Empty) | Stop serving this record to the network. If other peers try to retrieve this record, the peer will refuse the request. |
| Search | [SearchRequest](#routing-v1-SearchRequest) | [SearchResponse](#routing-v1-SearchResponse) stream | Search records based on the request across the network. This will search the network for the record with the given parameters.

It is possible that the records are stale or that they do not exist. Some records may be provided by multiple peers.

Results from the search can be used as an input to Pull operation to retrieve the records. |
| List | [ListRequest](#routing-v1-ListRequest) | [ListResponse](#routing-v1-ListResponse) stream | List all records that this peer is currently providing that match the given parameters. This operation does not interact with the network. |
