# Specification & Support

An AI Agentic Framework is a structured approach to designing AI systems that
autonomously perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions. It
encompasses key components such as perception, decision-making, action,
learning, interaction, ethics and safety, adaptability, and continuous
evaluation. This framework ensures that AI agents operate effectively and
responsibly, improving over time through learning, while maintaining ethical
standards and safety protocols. By integrating these elements, AI agents can
provide significant value in various applications, adapting to changing
conditions and user needs.

Below are specification of currently supported AI agentic frameworks.
