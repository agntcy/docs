# Agent Gateway Protocol

The Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP) facilitates communication between AI agents.
It supports various communication patterns such as request-response,
publish-subscribe, fire-and-forget, and streaming. Built on the gRPC framework,
the Agent Gateway ensures secure and scalable interactions among agents.


## Features

- **Request-Response**: Supports synchronous communication between agents.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Allows agents to publish messages to topics and subscribe to receive messages from topics.
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Enables agents to send messages without waiting for a response.
- **Streaming**: Supports both unidirectional and bidirectional streaming.
- **Security**: Employs authentication, authorization, and end-to-end encryption to protect data privacy and integrity.

## Source tree

Main software components:

- [data-plane](./data-plane): client and cloud components for efficient message
  forwarding among agents
- [control-plane](./control-plane): cloud services to manage control-plane ops
  carried out by agents

## Prerequisites

To build the project and work with the code, you will need the following
installed in your system:

### [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/)

Taskfile is required to run all the build operations. Follow the
[installation](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) instructions in the Taskfile
documentations to find the best installation method for your system.
