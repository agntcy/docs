# Control Plane

The Control Plane is a cloud-based controller that manages and orchestrates the configuration of agent gateway networks. It enables administrators to define, control, and interconnect limited domain networks while facilitating peering relationships with external networks.

## Key Components

### Central Controller

- Provides centralized management interface
- Handles network-wide configuration
- Monitors gateway health and status
- Implements control policies

### Policy Manager

- Defines access control policies
- Manages traffic routing rules
- Sets security parameters
- Controls resource allocation

### Topology Manager

- Maintains network topology
- Handles gateway discovery
- Manages gateway connections
- Optimizes routing paths

### Peering Registry

- Manages peering relationships
- Handles cross-network authentication
- Controls inter-network routing
- Maintains peering agreements
