# Workflow Server Manager

The workflow server manager (wfsm) is a command line tool that streamlines the process of wrapping an agent into a container image, starting the container and exposing the agent functionality through the Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)

The `wfsm` tool takes an [agent manifest](agent-manifest.md) as input and based on it spins up a web server container exposing the agent through ACP through REST api
