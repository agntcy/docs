# Data Model Description

The data model schema defines a set of standards for AI agent content representation that aims to:

- Define common data structure to facilitate content standardisation, validation, and interoperability
- Ensure unique agent identification to address content identity and consumption
- Provide extension capabilities to enable support of additional features like security and categorisation
- Expose common interfaces for content management and discovery to enable implementation of custom services
