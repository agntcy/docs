# Abstract

Agentic AI will accelerate all of human work. We believe that an open, interoperable Internet of Agents is the key to enabling the best possible path forward for innovation and creating the most value for all participants, from builders to operators, developers to consumers across all industries and businesses.

The AGNTCY is where we are building the Internet of Agents to be accessible for all: A diverse, collaborative space to innovate, develop, and maintain software components that solve key problems in the domain of agentic workflows and multi-agent applications.

The AGNTCY is a collective of AI industry leaders and stewards, researching, developing and advancing the state of the art in agentic AI based on principles of open innovation and interoperability. Our projects focus on open infrastructure, services and specifications to enable inter-agent collaboration in pursuit of driving innovation and value for all, from developers to operators, vendors to customers.
