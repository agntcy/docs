Network of Assistants (NoA) Tutorial

Welcome to the NoA tutorial, where you'll learn how to develop multi-agent
applications utilizing AGP's multicast capabilities to establish a collaborative
"chat room" environment for multiple assistants.

In this context, an assistant refers to an agent with expertise in a specific product.
While an assistant can provide excellent support for a particular product, creating
a single assistant capable of addressing inquiries across various products is a
challenging task. This tutorial will demonstrate how to leverage the collective
knowledge of specialized assistants to overcome this complexity and enhance the
overall user experience.
