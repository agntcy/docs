# SLIM Messaging Layer

The [SLIM](slim-core.md) Messaging Layer implements an efficient message routing and
delivery system between applications.

## Client and Channel Naming

In SLIM, all endpoints are identified by a routable name. To send a message to a
specific client, an application sends the message to its unique name. Client
names follow this pattern:

```
org/namespace/service/client
```

- **Organization**: The first component identifies the organization that deploys
  the application.
- **Namespace**: This can be used to segment client deployments. For example,
  in a multi-region deployment, the namespace might indicate the application's
  location. It can be adapted to fit other user requirements as well.
- **Service**: This component specifies the service exposed by the client. When
  multiple instances of the same client are deployed (such as several pods in a
  Kubernetes cluster), the organization, namespace, and service components
  remain the same for all instances.
- **Client**: The final component is generated by SLIM and is a hash of the
  client's identity (e.g., a hash of the public key). This uniquely identifies
  each specific client instance.

This naming structure supports both Anycast and Unicast message delivery:

- **Anycast**: By specifying only the first three components, a message can be
  sent to any one of the running clients sharing that name.
- **Unicast**: By including the fourth component, the message is delivered
  directly to the specified client instance.

This approach enables efficient client discovery in fact the message will be
delivered by the SLIM network to a client that is able to process it, even if the
real name of the client is unknown. The anycast forwarding is mostly used in
this discovery phase.

In addition to client endpoints, SLIM allows messages to be sent to Channels. A
Channel acts as a message group, allowing multiple clients to connect and
receive all messages exchanged on that channel. The channel name follows the
same structure as client names, but the last component is left empty, as it is
shared among all connected clients.

For further details, please refer to the [SLIM
Specification](https://spec.slim.agntcy.org/379-internet-draft-version-0-which-covers-all-main-components/draft-agntcy-slim.html)

## SLIM Sessions Layer

The SLIM platform includes a session layer that connects application frameworks
to the underlying SLIM messaging infrastructure. This layer provides a simple
interface that abstracts the complexity of secure messaging and message
distribution from the application.

The session layer offers several functionalities:

- **Security**: All messages in SLIM are encrypted by default using the [MLS
  protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html), which guarantees
  end-to-end encryption even when messages traverse intermediate nodes where TLS
  connections are terminated. The session layer is responsible for MLS group
  creation and updates, as well as message encryption and decryption.
- **Channel Management**: The session layer enables clients to be invited to or
  removed from a channel as needed.
- **Message Delivery**: The session layer abstracts message passing between
  applications and the SLIM message distribution network. It handles message
  formatting, routing, and delivery confirmation, while providing simple send
  and receive primitives to applications.

The session layer provides two main APIs: a 1:1 session, where two clients
communicate directly, and a group session, where multiple clients exchange
messages on a shared channel.

### One-to-one Session

A one-to-one (1:1) session is used when an application needs to communicate with
a single endpoint. It supports several modes:

- **Reliable or Unreliable**: Applications can choose whether the session layer
  implements retransmission mechanisms for reliable communication or disables
  them for lower overhead.
- **Fire-and-Forget or Request/Reply**: In fire-and-forget mode, the
  application sends a message to the other endpoint without waiting for a reply.
  For reliable sessions, retransmissions are handled transparently by the
  session layer. In request/reply mode, a timeout is setup at application level,
  which is cancelled when the other endpoint replies.
- **Anycast or Sticky**: In anycast mode, each message can be forwarded to a
  different client exposing the same service name, which is useful for stateless
  applications. In sticky mode, the first message is sent using anycast to
  discover an available client; subsequent messages are sent to the same
  endpoint.

By default, all sessions are secured using MLS. In a 1:1 session, the group
consists of only two clients, which must maintain some state for the MLS
protocol. When MLS is enabled, the session is automatically forced to use the
sticky mode, so that all the messages will be sent to the same client.

### Group Session

In an N:N (group) session, multiple clients can exchange messages on the same
channel. There are two types of clients in this session: a standard participant
that can only be invited to the channel and participate in messaging, and a
moderator. The moderator is a special client that has the following functionalities:

- **Invite/Remove clients**: The moderator is the only client that can create a
  channel and can modify the list of clients participating in the group
  communication.
- **MLS state management**: A channel has also an associated MLS group to
  guarantee security. The moderator performs the functionalities of the MLS
  delivery service, that routes MLS messages among the group participants in
  order to keep the state always updated.

As for the naming, for more information on the session layer, see the [SLIM
Specifications](https://spec.slim.agntcy.org/379-internet-draft-version-0-which-covers-all-main-components/draft-agntcy-slim.html)

## Example: Group Communication

This tutorial will show how to set up a secure group communication system using
SLIM. The group will be created by defining a pub-sub session with a moderator,
which will invite the other members. Messages will be sent to the shared
channel, where every member can read and write. Messages are end-to-end
encrypted using the [MLS
protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420).

### Key Features

- **Name-based Addressing**: In SLIM, all endpoints (channels and clients) have
  a name, and messages use a name-based addressing scheme for content routing.
- **Session Management**: Allows for the creation and management of sessions
  with moderators.
- **Broadcast Messaging**: Facilitates broadcast messaging to multiple
  subscribers.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures secure communication using the [MLS
  protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420).

### Setting up the SLIM Instance

As all members of the group will be communicating via a SLIM network, we can
set up a SLIM instance representing the SLIM network. We will use the pre-built
docker image for this purpose.

First execute this command to create the SLIM configuration file. Details about
the configuration can be found in the [SLIM
Repo](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/tree/main/data-plane/config).

```bash
cat << EOF > ./config.yaml
tracing:
  log_level: info
  display_thread_names: true
  display_thread_ids: true

runtime:
  n_cores: 0
  thread_name: "slim-data-plane"
  drain_timeout: 10s

services:
  slim/0:
    pubsub:
      servers:
        - endpoint: "0.0.0.0:46357"
          tls:
            insecure: true

      clients: []
EOF
```

This configuration will start a SLIM instance with a server listening on port
46357, without TLS encryption for simplicity. Messages will be still encrypted
using the MLS protocol, but the connections between SLIM nodes will not use TLS.
In a production environment, it is recommended to always use TLS and configure
proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

You can run the SLIM instance using Docker:

```bash
docker run -it \
    -v ./config.yaml:/config.yaml -p 46357:46357 \
    ghcr.io/agntcy/slim:latest /slim --config /config.yaml
```

If everything goes fine, you should see an output like this one:

```

```

### Configure Client Identity and Implementing the SLIM App

Each member of the group will run a local slim app instance that will be used to
communicate with the SLIM network. Also each member will have a unique identity
that will be used to authenticate the member in the SLIM network.

#### Identity

Each member of the group must have a unique identity. This is a requirement to
setup the end-to-end encryption using the MLS protocol. The identity can be
represented by a JWT, or a shared secret. For simplicity, we will use a shared
secret. You can find examples using JWT in the [SLIM
Repo](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/blob/main/data-plane/python-bindings/examples/src/slim_bindings_examples/common.py#L71-L112).

The python objects managing the identity are called `PyIdentityProvider` and
`PyIdentityVerifier`. The `PyIdentityProvider` is responsible for providing the
identity, while the `PyIdentityVerifier` is responsible for verifying the
identity.

```python
def shared_secret_identity(
    identity: str, secret: str
) -> tuple[PyIdentityProvider, PyIdentityVerifier]:
    """
    Create a provider and verifier using a shared secret.

    :param identity: A unique string, identifier of the app.
    :param secret: A shared secret used for authentication.
    :return: A tuple of (provider, verifier).
    """
    provider: PyIdentityProvider = PyIdentityProvider.SharedSecret(
        identity=identity, shared_secret=secret
    )
    verifier: PyIdentityVerifier = PyIdentityVerifier.SharedSecret(
        identity=identity, shared_secret=secret
    )

    return provider, verifier
```

#### SLIM App

The provider and the verifier will be used to create a local SLIM app, that can
be used to exchange messages with other apps via the SLIM network.

```python
async def create_slim_app(secret: str, local_name: PyName) -> PyService:
    """
    Create a SLIM app instance with the given shared secret.
    This app will be used to communicate with other SLIM nodes in the network.

    :param secret: A shared secret used for authentication.
    :param local_name: A unique name for the SLIM app instance.
                       It will be used to identify the app in the SLIM network.
    :return: A SLIM app instance.
    """

    # Create the provider and verifier using the shared secret.
    provider, verifier = shared_secret_identity(
        identity=f"{local_name}",
        secret=secret,
    )

    # Create the SLIM app. This is a in-process SLIM client that can be used to
    # exchange messages with other SLIM nodes in the network.
    slim_app = await Slim.new(local_name, provider, verifier)

    # Connect the SLIM app to the SLIM network.
    _ = await slim_app.connect(
        {"endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:46357", "tls": {"insecure": True}}
    )

    # Return the SLIM app instance.
    return slim_app
```

### Implementing the Moderator

The moderator will be responsible for creating the group and inviting other
members. The moderator will create a session and send an invitation message to
the other members. The invitation will contain the session ID and the channel
name for the group communication.

The moderator can be implemented as a Python service using the SLIM SDK.

#### Creating the Session and Inviting Members

The moderator creates a session and invites other members to join the group. The
session will be identified by a unique session ID, and the group communication
will take place over a specific channel name. The moderator will be responsible
for managing the session lifecycle, including creating, updating, and
terminating the session as needed.

As each participant is provided with an identity, setting up MLS for end-to-end
encryption is straightforward. The moderator will create a session with the
`mls_enabled` flag set to `True`, which will enable the MLS protocol for the
session. This ensures that all messages exchanged within the session are
end-to-end encrypted, providing confidentiality and integrity for the group
communication.

```python
async def create_session_and_invite_members(
    slim_app: PyService, invitees: list[PyName]
):
    """
    Create a session with the given session ID and channel ID.

    :param slim_app: The SLIM app instance.
    :return: The created session.
    """

    # Define the shared channel for group communication.
    # This channel will be used by all members of the group to exchange messages.
    shared_channel = PyName("agntcy", "namespace", "group_channel")

    # Create a new session. The group session is a bidirectional streaming session.
    # Here is where we enable the MLS protocol for end-to-end encryption.
    session_info = await slim_app.create_session(
        PySessionConfiguration.Streaming(
            PySessionDirection.BIDIRECTIONAL,
            topic=shared_channel,  # The channel ID for group communication.
            moderator=True,  # This session is created by the moderator.
            max_retries=5,  # Maximum number of retries for reliability.
            timeout=datetime.timedelta(seconds=5),  # Timeout for message delivery.
            mls_enabled=True,  # Enable MLS for end-to-end encryption.
        )
    )

    print(f"Session created: {session_info}")

    # Invite other members to the session.
    for invitee in invitees:
        print(f"Inviting {invitee}")
        await slim_app.set_route(invitee)  # Allow messages to be sent to the invitee.
        await slim_app.invite(
            session_info, invitee
        )  # Send an invitation to the invitee.

    # Return the created session.
    return session_info

async def run_moderator(secret: str):
    local_name = PyName("agntcy", "namespace", "moderator")

    # Create the moderator SLIM app instance.
    moderator_slim_app = await create_slim_app(secret, local_name)

    # Define the invitees for the group session.
    invitees = [
        PyName("agntcy", "namespace", "participant1"),
    ]

    async with moderator_slim_app:
        # Create a session and invite the members.
        session_info = await create_session_and_invite_members(moderator_slim_app, invitees)

        # Wait for a bit to ensure all participants are ready.
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

        # Send a message to the group channel.
        await send_message(moderator_slim_app, session_info, "Hello group!")

        # Wait for a message from a participant
        _, msg = await moderator_slim_app.receive(session=session_info.id)

        # Print message
        print(f"Received message from participant: {msg.decode()}")
```

### Implementing the Group Participants

The group participants will be implemented similarly to the moderator, but they
will not create the session. They will create the SLIM service instance and wait
for invites sent by the moderator. Once they receive the invite, they can read
and write on the shared channel.

```python
async def run_participant(secret: str):
    local_name = PyName("agntcy", "namespace", "participant1")

    participant_slim_app = await create_slim_app(secret, local_name)

    print(f"Listening for sessions - locator: {local_name}")

    async with participant_slim_app:
        # Listen for new sessions opened by moderators
        recv_session, _ = await participant_slim_app.receive()

        # Session is received, now we can read and write on the shared channel.
        print(f"Received session: {recv_session.id}")

        # Receive messages from the session
        recv_session, msg_rcv = await participant_slim_app.receive(session=recv_session.id)

        # Print the message
        print(f"Received: {msg_rcv.decode()}")

        # Reply with a message
        await participant_slim_app.publish(
            recv_session,
            f"{msg_rcv.decode()} from participant".encode(),
            recv_session.destination_name,
        )

        # Wait to ensure message is sent
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

### Putting All Together

Here is the complete code to run the moderator and the participants in a single
script. You can run this script to see how the group communication works using
SLIM.

## Example: 1:1 Communication

The slim repository also includes examples of 1:1 communication sessions. Using
the SLIM SDK for 1:1 sessions is very similar to the approach demonstrated in
the group communication example. For reference, see the
[fire_and_forget.py](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/blob/main/data-plane/python-bindings/examples/src/slim_bindings_examples/fire_and_forget.py)
and
[request_reply.py](https://github.com/agntcy/slim/blob/main/data-plane/python-bindings/examples/src/slim_bindings_examples/request_reply.py)
files.

1:1 communication is particularly useful when you want to use SLIM as a
transport layer for protocols that are inherently point-to-point, such as MCP or
A2A. In these cases, you typically need to communicate with a single server, but
you can still benefit from the simplicity and security that the SLIM messaging
layer provides.

For a detailed guide on using MCP on top of SLIM, please refer to the [SLIM and
MCP Integration](slim-mcp.md) page
