# Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging (SLIM)

Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging (SLIM) is a secure, scalable, and user-friendly communication framework that unifies state-of-the-art capabilities from various communication frameworks into a single implementation.

SLIM provides the following features:

- **Request-Response**: Supports synchronous communication between agents.
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Allows agents to publish messages to topics and subscribe to receive messages from topics.
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Enables agents to send messages without waiting for a response.
- **Streaming**: Supports both unidirectional and bidirectional streaming.
- **Security**: Employs authentication, authorization, and end-to-end encryption to protect data privacy and integrity.

The main components of SLIM are:

- [Security layer](../messaging/slim-security-layer.md)
- [Data plane](../messaging/slim-data-plane.md)
- [Session layer](../messaging/slim-session-layer.md)
- [SLIMController](../messaging/slim-controller.md)

To get started with SLIM, see the [Getting Started with SLIM](../messaging/slim-howto.md) guide.
