# Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging (SLIM)

Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging (SLIM) is a secure, scalable, and
user-friendly communication framework that unifies state-of-the-art capabilities
from various communication frameworks into a single implementation.

SLIM provides the following features:

- **Security**: Employs authentication, authorization, and end-to-end encryption
  to protect data privacy and integrity.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale deployments with high throughput
  and low latency. SLIM nodes can be distributed across heterogeneous environments,
  allowing for flexible scaling options.
- **Simplicity**: Offers a simple and intuitive API for developers, making
  it easy to integrate into applications. SLIM abstracts complex messaging patterns
  and provides a consistent interface for various communication needs.
- **Low Latency**: SLIM's architecture is designed to minimize latency while
  maintaining high throughput, making it suitable for applications that require
  low-latency interactions, such as AI Agents.

The main components of SLIM are:

- [SLIM Messaging Layer](./slim-data-plane.md)
- [SLIM Controller](./slim-controller.md)

To get started with SLIM, see the [Getting Started with
SLIM](../messaging/slim-howto.md) guide.
